### basics

### ECMA rules in summary

### primitives
  Number : contains both float and non float numbers
             +- ((2 pow 53) -1)
  BigInt : 
          const bigInt = 1234567890123456789012345678901234567890n;
          ---- doing any non safe changes to number give NAN value
  String : there is no char type
           string with zero char is also a string
  Boolean : true / false

  null : It’s just a special value which represents “nothing”, “empty” or “value unknown”

  undefined : The meaning of undefined is “value is not assigned”

  Object and Symbol : 
      Object are used to store collections of data and more complex entities.
      Symbol type is used to create unique identifiers for objects.

  typeof operator is to check the type of variable in run time
        exceptions of typeof For null returns "object" – this is an error in the language, it’s not actually an object.

### classes/objects inbuilt  
  
### data structures

### sorting, data manipulations

### classes/interfaces

## NOTES FOR REFERENCE
The spread syntax internally uses iterators to gather elements, the same way as for..of does.
